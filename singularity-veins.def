%help
    Singularity container for quickly building and running Veins simulations anywhere.
    Tested with Singularity 3.5.2.

    Run this container with its `--help` option for details:
    ```
    singularity run singularity-veins.sif --help
    ```

%setup
    # create stub hosts file contents (necessary for resolving "localhost" if network isolation is turned on)
    test -s "${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/etc/hosts" || echo '127.0.0.1\tlocalhost' >> "${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/etc/hosts"

%post
    set -e

    # Use default versions if environment variables (SINGULARITYENV_VEINS_VERSION etc.) are left unset
    : ${VEINS_VERSION=5.0}
    : ${OPP_VERSION=5.6}
